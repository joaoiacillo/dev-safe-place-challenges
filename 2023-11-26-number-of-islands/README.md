# (2023/11/26) Number of Islands

## Description

Write a function called 'numIslands' that takes a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water) as an argument and returns the number of islands in the grid.

## Rules

- You must post your code in the code challenge channel
- An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
- You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

## Example

```
numislands(grid) => 1
```
